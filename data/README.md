- [WangHo_Fig3b.txt]([WangHo_Fig3b.txt) is data transcribed from Fig 3b of [Wang et al](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03398-2/), showing only the pseudovirus data for the RBD mutants (note that the viruses named like B.1.351delta9 are pseudoviruses, whereas ones named B.1.351 are live virus.) These are data for convalescent patients.
